Welcome to the web home of Diffraction Microstructure Imaging (DMI). This website serves as a hub for information regarding diffraction-based (laboratory X-ray, synchrotron X-ray, and neutron) imaging techniques associated with the non-destructive 3-D characterization of microstructures in crystalline materials. These techniques include: 3-D X-ray diffraction / high-energy diffraction microscopy, diffraction contrast tomography, micro Laue diffraction, and energy dispersive diffraction mapping. With this commission, we hope to provide an educational resource for researchers in the rapidly growing field of DMI and to help connect researchers throughout the world. This commission has grown from two workshops regarding technical advances to DMI techniques held at the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (Hamburg, Germany, 2018) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (Gaithersburg, USA ,2020).

The information on this website is expected to be continuously updated and be of value to both expert and novice experimentalists. For experts, links to data analysis software and physical standard documentation is provided. For novices, training manuals, demonstration videos, and best practices information are also hosted. Lastly, information regarding upcoming events, including training workshops will be posted.
