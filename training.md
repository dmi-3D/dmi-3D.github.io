Below are links to various educational resources:

### X-ray Micromechanics Course
A series of recorded lectures connecting high-energy X-ray measurements and the micromechanical response of crystalline materials are available [online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYEboNz423A). Special focus is placed on providing the theory required to understand underlying algorithms in 3DXRD/HEDM methods. A corresponding set of notes for this course are available upon [request](mailto:dcp5303@psu.edu).

### TIMEleSS Multigrain Wiki
[TIMEleSS](http://multigrain.texture.rocks/) is an online wiki to provide instructions and strategies for processing high-pressure multigrain crystallography data. While focused on high-pressure analysis, many instruction sets availble are applicable to all 3DXRD / HEDM DMI measurements.
