As part of advancing DMI techniques, regular workshops are help for the DMI community to gather and present the state-of-the-art in measurement and science. If you have an idea for hosting a workshop, please contact [Darren Pagan](mailto:dcp5303@psu.edu).

## Technical Aspects of Synchrotron X-ray and Neutron Measurements for Diffraction Microstructure Imaging
### July 15-27, 2020
### Organizing Committee:
* Thien Phan, Chair, NIST 
* Darren Pagan, CHESS 
* Ulrich Lienert, DESY 
* Adam Creuziger, NIST 

### Summary:

On July 15-17, 2020, the DMI community hosted its first workshop in collaboration with the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST). The workshop was titled “Technical Aspects of Synchrotron X-ray and Neutron Measurements for Diffraction Microstructure Imaging.” The workshop provided a forum to present the latest developments in DMI data acquisition, management, and reconstruction, in addition to highlighting new in-situ sample environments compatible with DMI techniques. A special session was dedicated to the application of DMI techniques to supporting the development of new advanced manufacturing technologies. Discussion sections focused on the development of physical and software standards for DMI measurements and the building of an International Union of Crystallography commission for this research community. The workshop was attended by over 70 researchers performing DMI measurements (both novice and experts) from around the world.

The agenda for the workshop can be found [here](https://github.com/dmi-3D/dmi-3D.github.io/blob/master/public/NIST_WKSHP_Agenda.pdf). Some presentations can be made available by request. Please e-mail [Darren Pagan](mailto:dcp5303@psu.edu) for more information if interested.

The DMI community would live to provide a special thanks to Dr. Alkan Donmez and the NIST Engineering Directorate for support of this workshop.
